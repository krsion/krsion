Hi, I'm interested in distributed systems and systems performance.

**My Research**
- I attended [Third ACM Europe Summer School on
Distributed and Replicated Environments (DARE 2025)](https://dare-lisbon.github.io/)
- Currently I'm working on [MyDenicek](https://krsion.github.io/MyDenicek) ([proposal.pdf](https://github.com/krsion/MyDenicek/blob/main/proposal/proposal.pdf)), a local-first version of [Denicek: Computational Substrate for Document-Oriented End-User Programming](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3746059.3747646)

**My Hobby Projects:**
- Playground of Causal Broadcast https://krsion.github.io/causal-broadcast/
- Time tracker saving data to local storage which I use for work. https://krsion.github.io/time-tracker/
